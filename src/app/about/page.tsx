        <p className="mt-3">
          Abhilekh is a public, crowdsourced reference for the political history of every Indian
          state and union territory: who governed, when, under which party, what elections
          decided it, and what happened along the way. Paper leaks, corruption cases, policy
          failures, communal incidents, collapsing bridges: the events that shaped how each
          state was actually run.
        </p>
        <p>
          It exists because this record is scattered across news archives, gazettes, and memory.
          Bringing it into one place, year by year and state by state, makes it possible to ask
          simple questions and get sourced answers.

        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Everything is sourced.</strong> A submission without at least one citation
            (title, link, date) is rejected before it reaches a human.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Everything is reviewed.</strong> No contribution touches the public record
            until a moderator has compared it, field by field, against the live version and its
            sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Everything is versioned.</strong> Every proposal becomes a permanent public
            record, whether it was accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. It shows who proposed
            what, when, with what sources, and how it was decided. See any state&rsquo;s{" "}
